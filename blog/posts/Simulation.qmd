This tends to be a review on how to do simulation. In this blog, we want to present a simulation of the front door estimation in causal inference. The setting is created by Bellemare and Bloem on their paper draft *The Paper of How: Estimating Treatment Effects Using the Front-Door Criterion* in 2020. 

Our simulation setup is as follows. Let $U_i \sim N(0,1), Z_i \sim U(0,1), \epsilon_{X_i} \sim N(0,1), \epsilon_{M_i} \sim N(0,1)$, and $\epsilon{\gamma_i} \sim N(0,1)$ for a sample size of $N=100,000$ observations. Then, let
$$
X_i=0.5 U_i+\epsilon_{X_i},
$$
$$
M_i=Z_i Xi+\epsilon_{M_i},
$$
and
$$
Y_i=0.5 M_i+0.5 U_i+\epsilon{\mathrm{Y_i}}
$$

### Turn the simulation into Pseudocode

The pseudocode is an revision from Claude 3.5's generation. 
```{.python}
ALGORITHM: Front Door Criterion Simulation

BEGIN
    SET random seed for reproducibility
    
    // Generate random variables
    FOR i = 1 to N DO
        U[i] ← DRAW from Normal(mean=0, sd=1)
        Z[i] ← DRAW from Uniform(min=0, max=1)
        epsilon_X[i] ← DRAW from Normal(mean=0, sd=1)
        epsilon_M[i] ← DRAW from Normal(mean=0, sd=1)
        epsilon_Y[i] ← DRAW from Normal(mean=0, sd=1)
    END FOR

    // Generate structural equations
    FOR i = 1 to N DO
        // First equation
        X[i] ← 0.5 * U[i] + epsilon_X[i]
        
        // Second equation
        M[i] ← Z[i] * X[i] + epsilon_M[i]
        
        // Third equation
        Y[i] ← 0.5 * M[i] + 0.5 * U[i] + epsilon_Y[i]
    END FOR

    // Store results
    CREATE data structure containing:
        - Input variables: U, Z
        - Error terms: epsilon_X, epsilon_M, epsilon_Y
        - Structural variables: X, M, Y

END

OUTPUT:
    Dataset containing all generated variables
    Summary statistics
```

From the Pseudocode, we can observe that
