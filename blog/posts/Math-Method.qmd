Take notes. Reorganize them. Write proofs. Review them. These are the most simplistic abstraction on

### How to Analyze a Proof 

In the next part, there is a question that is worthwhile to consider how to write a good proof. 

In this question you will investigate connections between different types of convergences of sequences of continuous functions. Let $\left\{f_n\right\} \subseteq C[a, b]$, recall that we defined pointwise and uniform convergence in class. Let $f:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function, we say that $f_n$ converges to $f$ in $L^2$ if

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_a^b\left(f_n(x)-f(x)\right)^2 d x \rightarrow 0 \text { as } n \rightarrow \infty .
$$

(Here we are assuming the integral exists for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ).

(a) Show that uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence

(b) Show that uniform convergence implies convergence in $L^2$.

(c) In class we showed that pointwise convergence does not imply uniform convergence. Show that convergence in $L^2$ also does not imply uniform convergence.

First, we want to analyze the proof of the first part of the proof.

### Proof (a)

In $C[a,b]$, we have $f_n \to f$ pointwisely if for all $x \in [a,b]$, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists
$N = N(\epsilon,x)$ such that $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$ for all $n \geq N$.
Suppose $f_n \to f$ uniformly. Then, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N = N(\epsilon)$ such that
$|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$ for all $n \geq N$ and for all $x \in [a,b]$. Thus, if the sequence ${f_n}$
converges uniformly, for every $\epsilon > 0$ and every $x \in [a,b]$ we can choose this same $N = N(\epsilon)$ such that
$$
|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon
$$
This means the sequence converges to $f \in C[a,b]$ pointwisely, since having 
an $N$ that works for all $x$ certainly gives us an $N$ that works for each individual $x$.

Then, we start to analysis.

## Proof with Step-by-Step Motivation

1. **Statement**:  
   In $C[a,b]$, we have $f_n \to f$ pointwisely if for all $x \in [a,b]$, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists
   $N = N(\epsilon,x)$ such that $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$ for all $n \geq N$.
   
   [**Motivation**: Start with the formal definition of pointwise convergence, which is our target to prove.]

2. **Statement**:  
   Suppose $f_n \to f$ uniformly.
   
   [**Motivation**: State our given condition, which is what we'll use to prove pointwise convergence.]

3. **Statement**:  
   Then, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N = N(\epsilon)$ such that $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$ 
   for all $n \geq N$ and for all $x \in [a,b]$.
   
   [**Motivation**: Write out the definition of uniform convergence, noting that N depends only on $\epsilon$, not on x.]

4. **Statement**:  
   Thus, if the sequence ${f_n}$ converges uniformly, for every $\epsilon > 0$ and every $x \in [a,b]$ we can choose this same $N = N(\epsilon)$ such that
   $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$.
   
   [**Motivation**: Rephrase the uniform convergence condition to highlight that N works for every x.]

5. **Statement**:  
   This means the sequence converges to $f \in C[a,b]$ pointwisely, since having 
   an $N$ that works for all $x$ certainly gives us an $N$ that works for each individual $x$.
   
   [**Motivation**: Conclude by showing that uniform convergence satisfies pointwise convergence definition, 
   as a stronger condition implies a weaker one.]

If we can notify the motivation of each sentence of our proof, we can be more aware on how the proof works. 
Use your pen. Start to draw from the beginning of a sentence and stop at the period. Then ask:

"What is the motivation of this, specific sentence?"

Such a interrogation is a methodology from my reading of Heidegger's `Being and Time`. But many mathemataicains 
definitely use this without studying philosophy. For me, all my methodology are from my philosophical education
